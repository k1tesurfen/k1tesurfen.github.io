            <p>
              A key missing part of Virtual Reality is grabbing with haptic feedback. In the real world we explore
              things by taking them into our hands. We rotate them, bring them closer to our face. As a university
              project we created ReGraT. In a team of two we explored the use of motion tracking and a 3D printed custom
              controller to simulate haptic feedback. For the project two major algorithms were developed. A skeleton
              solver and a redirection algorithm. The skeleton solver creates a virtual representation of the hand from
              motion tracking data. To feel a haptic feedback whilst grabbing objects of different size, we redirect the
              virtual fingers to during the grabbing motion. The player will always touch the same physical controller
              whereas in the virtual world the hand will be touching objects of different sizes. <br> Let's see how
              these two algorithms work.

            <h3 class="major">Skeleton Solver</h3>
            <p>
              A skeleton solver is an algorithm that usually takes a set of markers and derives a set of bones to
              animate from it. This algorithm is typicall applied to a set of markers on a motion capture suit. But for
              ReGraT we developed our own skeleton solving algorithm for hand bones only.
            </p>
            <p>
              A typical grabbing motion will use the index finger and the thumb on the opposite site. Imagine grabbing a
              glass of your favourite beverage. The other fingers of the hand will follow the index finger. So solving
              the index finger and thumb will suffice for an accurate representation of a grab.

            </div>
            <p>
              To solve the skeleton we use a calibration phase in the beginning. During this phase the user will strike
              hand poses as shown in the image above. In the pointing pose we can determine the markers for the index
              finger and the thumb by sorting from left to right. Then we sort for distance of the markers from the
              center of the back of the hand. This will give us the markers for each finger section. After this
              calibration phase there is no complex recalculation each frame. Our motion tracking cameras have a
              framerate of 120 fps, which lets us compare the previously solved markers with the currently unsolved
              makers of the current frame. Each old marker will be replaced with the closest new marker. This results in
              a solved skeleton for each frame. For normal and even fast motion this method is robust enough to not
              loose track of the skeleton structure.

            <h3 class="major">Redirection</h3>
            <p>
              To create real haptic feedback we use a 3D printed controller that sits right at the point where thumb and
              index finger meet. It is attatched to the back of the hand so it moves with the hand gestures at all
              times. We cannot change the physical size of the controller to accomodate different sizes of virtual
              objects. Our solution to this problem was to manipulate the virtual grabbing motion to match the moment of
              virtual an real touch. We can calculate the distance of the tip of the finger to the physical controller
              and match this distance in the virtual world no matter how big the virtual object is. For larger virtual
              objects this can look weird because the hand flips open too wide. We fixed this by reducing the
              redirection distance the bigger the virtual object gets.

            <h3 class="major">The Game</h3>
            <p>
              To test our method of recreating haptic feedback in virtual reality we created a small VR game. The player
              is situated in a futuristic spaceship and is given the task of sorting energy containers of different
              shapes into the matching receiver.

            <h3 class="major">Limitations and summary video</h3>
            <p>
              Due to the fact that the Optitrack motion captuiring system is built to be used for whole body motion we
              lack precision especially with the number of markers used in such a small space. Additionally we often
              occlude these markers with our own body parts. A possible solution to this problem could be to transfer
              the motion of visible markers to temporarily obstructed markers until they are visible again by the
              tracking cameras. Below you can see a summary video of the ReGraT system.
